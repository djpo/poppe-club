# poppe.club

this is my portfolio site, a place to share my projects and experiences. it's currently live at [poppe.club](https://poppe.club)!

for now it's showcasing only software projects, but in the coming months, I plan to show off other kinds of projects (including original music, dj recordings, work in film and theatre, improv comedy).

if you like what you see, let's talk! I'm looking for work! (contact info on [poppe.club](https://poppe.club), of course)

## how it's made

it's built using Svelte and SvelteKit. as my first Svelte project, it's been a great way to practice what I've learned. it's hosted with Vercel, using GitHub integration. I'm tracking my tasks using GitHub Issues.

the design is by my friend and talented designer [Jana Gramlich](https://janagramlich.com).

## installation

install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
